# NLP
Assignments that I completed for Natural Language Processing class at Columbia University in Summer 2019.

HW2: N-puzzle board game: implemented and compared breadth-first, depth-first, A-start search algorithms
HW3: Sudoku: implemented backtracking search with minimum remaining value heuristic to reduce variables domains
HW4: 2048-puzzle game: implemented an adversarial search agent to play using expectiminimax and alpha-beta pruning
HW5: Implemented Perceptron, Linear Regression, Clustering ML algorithms for data separation, prediction, RGB values
