# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

HW1: Implemented a trigram language model to extract, count, and obtain raw probabilities for n-grams

HW2: Implemented CKY algorithm for CFG and PCFG parsing and retrieved parse trees from a chart w/ tree data structures

HW3: Trained a feed-forward neural network to predict transitions of an arc-standard dependency parser w/ TensorFlow

HW4: Worked on a lexical substitution task, using both WordNet and pre-trained Word2Vec word embeddings w/ NLTK
